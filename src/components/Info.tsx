            The Fresnel zone is the area around the visual line-of-sight that radio
            waves spread out into after they leave the antenna. This area must be
            free from obstructions to ensure the received signal strength is
            adequate.

            The radius of the zone varies with the square root of the wavelength and
            inversely with the square root of the distance between the transmitter
            and receiver. The radius of the inner (first) Fresnel zone is given by:
